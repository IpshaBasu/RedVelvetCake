# Recipe for Red Velvet Cake
_Preheat oven to 350°F, grease cake pans. Line with parchment paper._
_Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a large bowl_
_Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and beat on high for 2 minutes_
_With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined_
_Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed_
_Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the cakes need a little longer as determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer_

_Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet_
_Start to apply frosting on the cake_
_Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing_
